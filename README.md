# Machine Learning
Hi, I'm Ngan Ha and I'm creating this repository to take notes of my Machine Learning lessons. Here, you may find my notes of ML concepts, explanation of the underlying maths, implementation of models, and some practices. I use both English and Vietnamese (mostly, because it's my mothertongue), since I believe that to understand a concept is to be able to elaborate it in every language I'm fluent in.

This repo is dedicated to personal learning. However, if you have comments or suggestions on it, please contact me via my email: phamnganhabkp@gmail.com
    
Thank you and happy learning!
